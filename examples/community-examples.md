# Community Examples
List of examples to learn from outside the core supported example set. These are not an endorcement but for reference of how others are using clack in community CLIs;

- **hax** - [npm init @haxtheweb](https://github.com/haxtheweb/create) - clack + [picocolors](https://npmjs.com/package/picocolors) + [commander](https://npmjs.com/package/commander) usage in order to create a robust cli DX where users can follow prompts (clack), run sub-tasks, or leverage arguments to skip parts of clack prompts (or entirely)
