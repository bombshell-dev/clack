The `@clack/core` package provides the fundamental building blocks for creating interactive command-line interfaces. It's designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy to use.

## Key Features

- **Low-level primitives**: Base components for building custom prompts
- **Type-safe**: Built with TypeScript for better developer experience
- **Flexible rendering**: Customizable rendering system for prompts
- **Cancel handling**: Built-in support for handling user cancellation

## Package Structure

The core package is organized into two main directories:

- `prompts/`: Contains the base prompt implementations
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions and helpers

## Core Components

### Base Prompt Class

The `Prompt` class serves as the foundation for all prompt types. It provides:

- Custom rendering capabilities
- Input handling
- State management
- Event system

### Available Prompts

1. **TextPrompt**: For text input
2. **SelectPrompt**: For selection from options
3. **ConfirmPrompt**: For yes/no confirmations

## Getting Started

To start using the core package, first install it:

```bash
npm install @clack/core
```

Then import the components you need:

```ts
import { TextPrompt, SelectPrompt, ConfirmPrompt } from '@clack/core';
```
