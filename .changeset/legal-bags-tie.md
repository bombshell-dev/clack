The package is now distributed as ESM-only. In `v0` releases, the package was dual-published as CJS and ESM.

For existing CJS projects using Node v20+, please see Node's guide on [Loading ECMAScript modules using `require()`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/modules.html#loading-ecmascript-modules-using-require).
