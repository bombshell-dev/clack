Adds `stream` API which provides the same methods as `log`, but for iterable (even async) message streams. This is particularly useful for AI responses which are dynamically generated by LLMs.

```ts
import * as p from '@clack/prompts';

await p.stream.step((async function* () {
    yield* generateLLMResponse(question);
})())
```
